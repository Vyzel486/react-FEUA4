Most of the monolithic reinforced concrete structures have already been erected since the start of the project, and now, beautification works have begun on the 20-storey complex with facades that require exceptional technological solutions. This is another important milestone in the development of this business centre, which is attracting the attention not only of a growing number of ordinary Vilnius residents but also of leading Lithuanian and international companies.",
